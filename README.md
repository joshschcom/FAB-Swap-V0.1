# FAB-Swap-V0.1
First public version FAB-Swap - Uniswap V2 Fork

# Deploying the smart-contracts
We start by deploying each Uniswap contract on the Ropsten Test Network using Remix. I suggest you to create a spreadsheet to store all the contracts’ addresses and other datas.

#Deploy Uniswap v2 Core
The Uniswap v2 Core’s smart-contracts (Also called Factory) can be found in their official Github repository (https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core).
